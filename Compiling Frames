I am using VSCode for Linux with the PlatformIO extension. I am able to create an STM32 based target. I have the source of a program that needs to compile and run on the host to create a source file for the STM32 executable. How do I set this up?

To set up a development environment in VSCode for Linux with the PlatformIO extension for an STM32 project, where part of the process involves compiling and running a program on the host to create a source file for the STM32 executable, you can follow these steps:

    Install VSCode and PlatformIO:
        If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from here.
        Install the PlatformIO extension for VSCode from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) by searching for "PlatformIO".

    Create the STM32 Project:
        Use PlatformIO to create a new project. Select the appropriate board and framework for your STM32 project.

    Setup Host Compilation:
        The host program (which generates the source file for the STM32) will need to be set up separately.
        Create a new folder for the host program within your project directory or elsewhere, depending on your preference.

    Configure the Host Program:
        If the host program is a C/C++ program, you can use the C/C++ extension for VSCode. Install it from the Extensions view.
        Set up a tasks.json file in the .vscode directory of your host program's folder. This file will contain the instructions to compile the host program. For example:

        json

    {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "label": "build host program",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "gcc",
                "args": [
                    "-o",
                    "host_program",
                    "source_file.c"
                ],
                "group": {
                    "kind": "build",
                    "isDefault": true
                }
            }
        ]
    }

    Replace "source_file.c" with the name of your host program's source file.

Automating the Build Process:

    To automate the process, you can use a PlatformIO pre-build script.
    Create a pre_extra_script.py file in the scripts folder of your PlatformIO project (create the scripts folder if it doesn't exist).
    Inside pre_extra_script.py, add Python code to invoke the build task for your host program. For example:

    python

        Import("env")
        import subprocess

        def before_build(source, target, env):
            # Build the host program
            subprocess.call(["path/to/your/host/folder", "build host program"])

        env.AddPreAction("buildprog", before_build)

        Modify "path/to/your/host/folder" and "build host program" according to your setup.

    Run the Host Program:
        After compiling, you need to run the host program to generate the required source file for the STM32. You can also add this step in the pre_extra_script.py using subprocess.call.

    Integrate the Generated File:
        Ensure that the generated file is placed in the correct location where your STM32 project expects it. You can automate this by adding file copy commands in the pre_extra_script.py.

    Build the STM32 Project:
        Now, when you build your STM32 project in PlatformIO, it should first run the pre-build script, which compiles and runs the host program and generates the necessary source file.

    Test and Debug:
        Test the entire process to ensure everything works as expected. Make adjustments as necessary.

This setup allows you to maintain a workflow where the host program is automatically built and run as part of your STM32 project's build process. Remember that the specifics might vary depending on the exact nature of your host program and how it integrates with your STM32 project.
